description: >-
  The Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that fully determines,
  while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to
  a subsequent request without revalidation. For uncacheable or stale responses, the Vary
  field value advises the user agent about the criteria that were used to select the
  representation. A Vary field value of "*" implies that a cache cannot determine from the
  request headers of a subsequent request whether this response is the appropriate
  representation. See RFC 2616 section 13.6 for use of the Vary header field by caches.
