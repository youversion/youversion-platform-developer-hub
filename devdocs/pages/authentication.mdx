The YouVersion Bible API uses App ID authentication to secure all requests. This ensures that only authorized applications can access the API.

## App ID Authentication

All API requests must include your App ID in the `X-App-Id` header. This header is required for every endpoint.

### Header Format

```
X-App-Id: YOUR_APP_ID
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -H "X-App-Id: YOUR_APP_ID" \
     https://api.youversion.com/v1/bibles
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 111,
      "abbreviation": "NIV",
      "title": "New International Version 2011",
      "language": {
        "iso_639_1": "en",
        "name": "English"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Your App ID

To obtain an App ID for the YouVersion Bible API:

1. Contact the YouVersion Platform Team
2. Provide details about your application and use case
3. Receive your unique App ID

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your App ID secure**: Never expose your App ID in client-side code or public repositories
- **Use environment variables**: Store your App ID in environment variables or secure configuration files
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Consider rotating your App ID periodically for enhanced security
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of your API usage to detect any unauthorized access

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing App ID"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

App IDs are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Check the response headers for rate limit information:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Multiple Environments

The API is available in multiple environments:

- **Development**: `https://api-dev.youversion.com/v1`
- **Production**: `https://api.youversion.com/v1`
- **Local**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1` (for development purposes)

Use the appropriate environment for your use case and ensure your App ID is valid for the environment you're targeting.
